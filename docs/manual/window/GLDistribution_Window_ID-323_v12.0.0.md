**Description:** General Ledger Distribution  
**Help:** If the account combination criteria of the Distribution is met, the posting to the account combination is replaced by the account combinations of the distribution lines.  The distribution is prorated based on the percentage of the lines. If the total percent is less then 100 and one line is 0 (null), it gets the remainder.  If there is no line with 0, any rounding is adjusted in the line with the biggest amount.
